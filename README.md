This repo contains examples of some C/C++ applications I have written.
encryptionserver - This was a server that ran on a Tru64 UNIX system.  It took a string as input and used a cipher to "encrypt" it.  This was an internal tool used to keep plain text passwords from appearing in config files.
LotusImport - A simple CPP application that was trying to cross reference data in a file with a Lotus Notes database
